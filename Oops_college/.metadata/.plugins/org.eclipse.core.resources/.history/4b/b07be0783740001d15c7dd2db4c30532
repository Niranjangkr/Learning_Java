Create two more classes InternalAcivity and ExternalActivity  which extend the Activity class. The internalActivity class has person_incharge as its own data member whereas the externalActivity has collegeName as its own data member. Use appropriate constructors and methods to set and display the details pertaining to external and internal activities.
