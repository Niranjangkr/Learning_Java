/*10.	8.	Create a class named Account with accno(long) and balance(float)  as instance variables. In the testing class , the account object is created using the following code:
Account ac1= new Account(‘A-1’);
 Where ‘A1’  is the Account number.
 Write appropriate constructor for  the above line of code in the Account class. Also provide appropriate getter/setter methods to initialize the balance.  Include a display method to display account details.
Objective: Constructors and getter/setter methods.

9.	Use  the Account class above , suppose two more  Account objects are created in the following way: 
Account ac2= new Account ();
Account ac3= new Account(‘A-3’,5000);
Include appropriate constructors to support the above object creation also include appropriate setdetails method to set the values of the remaining instance variables.
All these accounts belong to one particular branch named ‘Bank of Quepem’ . Store this details in a variable called bank_name and provide a method named ‘getBranch()  to return this name. Modify the display method to include a call to the getBranch() method. Also display the total number of accounts in the branch.
Objective : constructors, static variables and static methods.
